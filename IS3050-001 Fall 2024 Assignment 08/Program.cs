/* Follow these steps, then delete the steps from the module:
 * 0. All team members: meet to divide the assignment responsibilities:
 *                      (A) Team Member #1 will program the entry point code, Program.cs.
 *                      (B) The other team members will each program one class to model a real-world entity, per the assignment.
 *                      
 * 1. Team Member #1: fork and clone this VS Solution.
 * 2. Team Member #1: add a class module for each of the classes the other team members will write (see Step 0, above)
 * 3. Team Member #1: Commit and push the VS Solution. There will be multiple class modules in this new version: Program.cs and the mostly empty modules from Step 2, above.
 * 4. Team Members #2... : Fork and clone the repo from Step 3, above. 
 * 5. Team Members #2... : Modify the corresponding class module created in Step 2, above, per the assignment
 * 6. Team Members #2... : Commit and push, then create a Pull Request
 * 7. Team Member #1: Modify Program.cs as necessary (refer to the assignment), then commit and push
 * 8. Team Member #1: Open the repo on GitHub.com, accept the pull requests from Step 6, above. There should be no merge conflicts if all team members stayed in their lanes.
 * 9. All Team Members: Execute a Synch on your local VS Solution, verify that everything works as expected
 * 10. Any team member: Submit the appropriate URL to Canvas for grading.
