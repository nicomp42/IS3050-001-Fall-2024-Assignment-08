/* Follow these steps, then delete the steps from the module:
 * 0. All team members: meet to divide the assignment responsibilities:
 *                      (A) Team Member #1 will program the entry point code, Program.cs.
 *                      (B) The other team members will each program one class to model a real-world entity, per the assignment.
 *                      
 * 1. Team Member #1: fork and clone this VS Solution. https://github.com/nicomp42/IS3050-001-Fall-2024-Assignment-08
 * 2. Team Member #1: Add appropriate docuentation to Program.cs, commit and push the VS Solution to GitHub.
 * 3. Team Members #2... : Fork and clone the repo from Step 2, above. Be careful not to fork and clone the repo in my account. 
 * 4. Team Members #2... : Add your class module to the project and program it accordingly, per the assignment. Do not modify Program.cs.
 * 5. Team Members #2... : From VS, "Commit All and Synch", then from GitHub, create a Pull Request
 * 6. Team Member #1: Modify Program.cs as necessary (refer to the assignment), then from VS, "Commit All and Synch"
 * 7. Team Member #1: Open the repo on GitHub.com, accept and merge all the pull requests from Step 5, above. There should be no merge conflicts if all team members stayed in their lanes.
 * 8. All Team Members: Execute a Pull on your local VS Solution, verify that everything works as expected. If there's a problem, fix it, then from VS, "Commit All and Synch"
 * 9. Any team member: Submit the appropriate URL to Canvas for grading. At this point all the repos in the team should have the same contents, 
 *    but it you're unsure, use the repo from Team Member #1.
